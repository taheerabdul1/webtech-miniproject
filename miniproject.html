            <p>During my first year of university, I have learned how to program in Java using procedural and object-oriented frameworks.<br>
            I have also learned assembly language through the use of the application QTSpim, and Wireshark which is a packet analyser software.<br>
            I have also partaken in many different challenges and tournaments during my time in school.<br>
            One of these was the engineering challenge by the Stevenage Rotary Club. More information can be found <a href="https://www.thecomet.net/news/students-pipe-up-with-their-design-ideas-at-rotary-s-5359588">here</a>.</p>
